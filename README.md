For over twelve years I was a journalist in a convulsed Venezuela. Helping international news teams to find good stories was my passion until it got too dangerous and stressful. Since I have always considered myself a problem-solver before anything, I decided to take a leap of faith and follow my long-postponed dream to become a developer. Even though I know my trip has just started I am already proud of all the things I have learned and excited for the many many others I need to discover.

Growing up in a humble environment has taught me a lot and it makes me want to participate in developing solutions to make people's lives not only easier but happier.
I consider mediocrity humanity's worst enemy and I try my best to teach my 4-year-old daughter to always give her best and seriously commit to her dreams as I myself try to do.
I'm passionate about pop culture, anime, movies, drawing, photography and fashion design (this one because of my lovely wife); so if you would like to have a conversation about any of these topics do not hesitate to send me a whatsapp message to **+58-424-134127** or an email to **yesmanshiva@gmail.com**.

I have also gathered many interesting life lessons and crazy stories about living in a country like Venezuela so if you want to chat about it, hit me up too.
Even though I know some issues need solemnity and formality I enjoy casual conversations specially with people who are passionate about something. The next step for me is to find a job with an environment that allows me not just to offer my knowledge and skills but to grow both as developer and as a human.

_If you want to hear **the story behind my unconventional name** send me an email and I'll gladly share it with you._
